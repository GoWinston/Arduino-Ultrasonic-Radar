# Arduino-Ultrasonic-Radar
This is an arduino powered ultrasonic radar project created to teach the principles of stealth to middle school students.  

The display is run by a laptop with Processing, and communicates with the Arduino using USB serial.

There are two Processing sketches:  One for a basic radar display, and another one that is a game. 

Basic rules for the stealth game:  1) without anything other than yourself, try to see how close you can get to the radar without getting three strikes.  2) using any material you want (I like to bring lots of foam pieces) see how close you can get to the radar.  Person with the best score (closed to the radar) wins.
